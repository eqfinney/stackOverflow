## Stack Overflow Exploratory Analysis
Author: Emily Quinn Finney

An exploratory analysis conducted using data obtained from the 2017 Stack 
Overflow Developer Survey (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017).
I primarily conducted this analysis as a means of practicing Pandas and
comparing Python plotting tools. The modules in this repository are intended 
to be quick exploratory analyses and as such do not contain careful testing 
or code design. Several elements not yet implemented.
